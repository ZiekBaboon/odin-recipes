    <p><strong>Latkes (potato pancakes)</strong> are a must-have at Hanukkah, but are really wonderful any time of the year! This is my mother's recipe, which is honestly the best potato latke I've had. I usually end up making a second batch because they disappear so quickly. I've tried other recipes and always return to this one. Lovely topped with sour cream or applesauce.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p><ul>
        <li>3 cups shredded potato</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated onion</li>
        <li>6 saltine crackers, or as needed, crushed</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
    </ul></p>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p><ol>
        <li><h3>Step 1</h3></li>
        <p>Combine potato, onion, crushed crackers, eggs, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl.</p>
        <li><h3>Step 2</h3></li>
        <p>Heat 1/4 inch oil in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat</p>
        <li><h3>Step 3</h3></li>
        <p>Drop spoonfuls of potato mixture, first pressing mixture against side of the bowl to remove excess liquid, into hot oil; slightly flatten latkes with the back of a spoon to make an even thickness.</p>
        <li><h3>Step 4</h3></li>
        <p>Cook in batches until browned and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Drain latkes on a paper towel-lined plate.</p>
    </ol></p>
